CBMC-GC
-------

- good error message if OUTPUT (which includes the return value of mpc_main())
  is not assigned a value

- improved building blocks during compilation (triangle shape)

- adjust documentation

BUGS
- [BUG]infinite_minimization_loop (see test case)
	- bug does not occur when always returning false instead of equivalence_check_process_constants_bin()
	  in equivalence_check_process_bin()
	- not using equivalence_check_process_constants_bin() does not seem to have a big negative impact

OPTIMIZATIONS
- optimize building blocks to full extend. Get rid of all constants to compile faster (e.g., 
  multiplier will invoke adders with zeros, we shoud directly take FA/HA when required)

- in simple_circuitt::minimize():
	- rewrite_no_state_machine() vs minimizing_state_machine(): rewrite_no_state_machine() seems to
	  be better, at least when not optimizing for depth
	- MINIMIZER min = THEOREMS vs MINIMIZER min = OLD (OLD seems to be better, at least when not
	  optimizing for depth)


circuit-utils
-------------

- support boolean (1 bit) inputs/outputs
