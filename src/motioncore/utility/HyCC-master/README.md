# HyCC


This repository contains HyCC, a compiler for optimized circuits for hybrid MPC from ANSI-C, which is built as follow-up work to CBMC-GC [1] and the ABY framework [2].
Details to the underlying techniques are described in the corresponding paper [3].

## Workflow

The workflow is currently as follows:
  1. clone this repository and compile HyCC
  2. compile your C application using HyCC into a circuit consisting of modules
  3. create and select a circuit module bundle file
  4. evaluate the generated circuit (modules) using ABY

In the following sections we explain each step in more detail.


### 1. Compiling HyCC


Run in the root directory:

    make minisat2-download
    make


### 2. Compiling Circuits with HyCC


Example programs are given in examples/ and can be compiled with make.
Please have a look at the detailed documentation and paper listed at [2].
Make sure that your program is using CBMC-GC's i/o variable notation and
that the program is bound (loops/recursion) or specify an upper bound for
the loop unrolling:
  `--unwind X`
 where X is the upper bound on unrolling loops. To limit the circuit
 minimization phase please use (this is essential for large programs!):
  `--minimization-time-limit X`
where X is an integer value in seconds. To compile circuits with minimal
depth (ShallowCC) add the following flag:
  `--low-depth`

Note that the (depth) reduction preprocessing step described in [3] is
not contained in this release. Sequential arithmetics are compressed when
written in a single expression (t = a * b + c)!

The following looks for a function called `mpc_main` in `main.c` and generates a
single boolean circuit file `mpc_main.circ` for it:

    cbmc-gc main.c

By specifying `--bool <func_name>` or `--arith <func_name>` you can compile
individual functions into separate boolean or arithmetic circuit files (called
modules).
By specifying `--all-variants` you can compile all functions into
separate boolean and arithmetic circuits (compilation to arithmetic circuits is
not always possible).
When `--outline` is specified, the compiler will try to split the code into many smaller modules.
Use the last two options for Protocol Selection (see further
below).

In some cases HyCC does not provide useful error messages when the input C files
have issues (e.g., when accessing un-initialized memory).
Therefore, please make sure to check that the input C files work as intended on
plain data, for example by compiling it with a regular C compiler and checking
the binary with Valgrind.


#### Evaluating Circuits


The `circuit-sim` utility allows to evaluate (simulate) circuits in the clear.
(This is mostly useful for testing a generated circuit.) If you want to execute
the circuit in the file `adder.circ` that has two integer inputs `INPUT_A` and
`INPUT_B`, you can run the following command:

    circuit-sim adder.circ --spec "INPUT_A := 42; INPUT_B := 99; print;"

This will execute the circuit and then print the values of all input and output
variables.

Arrays can be specified with `[1, 2, 3]` and structs with `{a: 23; b: 48;}`
(don't forget the semicolon after the last attribute).

You can also specify assertions:

    circuit-sim adder.circ --spec "INPUT_A := 42; INPUT_B := 99; return_value == 141;"

This will print a error message if the output of the circuit is not 141.

Multiple runs of a circuit can be specified in a file.

    INPUT_A := 42;
    INPUT_B := 99;
    return_value == 141;
    ---
    INPUT_A := 100;
    INPUT_B := 200;
    return_value == 300;

If the above is saved to `test.spec` it can be run like so:

    circuit-sim adder.circ --spec-file test.spec


### 3. Circuit Module Bundle Generation and Protocol Selection

HyCC splits the full functionality into smaller parts, which are called modules.
For historical reasons each module currently has the file ending `.circ`.
To put together a full circuit, several modules are bundled in so-called circuit module bundles, or short `.cmb` files, which simply contain a list of modules (`.circ` files) and the respective sharings.
For this step to work properly, `cbmc-gc` must be invoked with `--all-variants` and optionally `--outline`.

`.cmb` files can be written by hand, or generated automatically:

1. *Heuristic solution:*
   Run `module_bundle.py module-directory/` to generate up to 5 possible default module configurations, for example:
   ./module_bundle.py examples/biomatch/

   This will generate `all.cmb`, `gmwonly.cmb`, `yaoonly.cmb`, and `gmwhybrid.cmb`, `yaohybrid.cmb`,
   which is a list of all available circuits, the full circuit with only GMW/Yao gates and no arithmetic gates, or a hybrid circuit where all arithmetic modules use arithmetic sharing, while the remaining modules are GMW/Yao.


2. *Optimized solution:*
   Given a cost function an efficient protocol selection can be made automatically. The cost can be determined using the output of ABY's [bench_operations](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY/tree/public/src/examples/bench_operations) and brought into the right format using `python bench_convert.py`, which creates a `costs.json` file. This file can also be manually modified.

   The protocol selection is then run using `python selection.py ../circuits costs.json` where `../circuits/` is a directory of `.circ` files.
   This will evaluate all possible module combinations, print them to the terminal and will write the most efficient one to `ps_optimized.cmb`.
   Alternatively the cost of an existing `.cmb` file can be evaluated by calling `python selection.py test.cmb costs.json`.

`.cmb` files can be passed to ABY in the next step.
Users can manually choose the `.cmb` file and thus the (hybrid) protocol that works best for their use case.


### 4. Evaluating Circuits with ABY

To use a generated circuit with ABY you need to:

1. Clone the [ABY framework](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY) to a location of your choice.
2. Copy the folder `HyCC/aby-hycc/` to `ABY/src/examples/aby-hycc/`.
3. In line 2 of `ABY/src/examples/aby-hycc/CMakeLists.txt` set the variable `HYCC_DIR` to the root directory of your HyCC installation, i.e., the directory that contains this README.
4. Add `add_subdirectory(aby-hycc)` to `ABY/src/examples/CMakeLists.txt`

The following steps are the default build process for ABY, as also described in the ABY README on <https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY>.

5. Create a build directory in the ABY directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
6. Run `cmake` in the `ABY/build` directory and enable building of executables: `cmake .. -DABY_BUILD_EXE=On`
7. Run `make` in the `ABY/build` directory: `make`
6. `ABY/build/bin/` should now contain a binary called `aby-hycc`.

`aby-hycc` needs to be put in the same directory as the circuits and `.cmb` files, e.g., by running `cp bin/aby-hycc ../../HyCC/examples/benchmarks/biomatch/`.

Example usage:

    aby-hycc -r 0 -c yaohybrid.cmb &
    aby-hycc -r 1 -c yaohybrid.cmb

The option `-r 0` starts `aby-hycc` as a server and `-r 1` as a client.

With the option `-c <filename.cmb>` a `.cmb` file can be specified for evaluation.

The parameter `--spec` is used to pass inputs to the parties, e.g.: `--spec "INPUT_B_sample := [0, 1, 2, 3];"
`.
Inputs starting with `INPUT_B` are associated with the server and the ones starting with `INPUT_A` with the client.


### Export to other formats


You can use `circuit-utils` to convert a circuit generated by CBMC-GC to another
format.

Currently supported export options:

- `--as-bristol`: Bristol format (<https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~nsmart/MPC/>).
  Note that currently it is not possible to use the Bristol format for circuits
  that directly connect input gates to output gates.
- `--as-shdl`: Fairplay's SHDL format.
- `--as-scd`: justGarble's Simple Circuit Description format.

Example:

    circuit-utils adder.circ --as-bristol bristol_circuit.txt

to convert the circuit to the Bristol format. If your framework is only
supporting AND, XOR and NOT gates (e.g., the EMP-toolkit), use

    circuit-utils adder.circ --remove-or-gates --as-bristol bristol_circuit.txt


## Tests


Building all tests: `make test`.

Running all tests: `make run-test`.

The above commands will create two copies of `test-src/`: `test-default/` and
`test-lowdepth/`. The only difference between them is that the tests in
`test-lowdepth/` will be compiled using `--low-depth`.

The basic idea is that `test-src/` contains only the source files of the tests
and that copies of the whole directory are made for each specific set of
command-line options to `cbmc-gc`. So do not run `make` directly in `test-src`
but only in copies of it.

For example, to test `cbmc-gc` with depth-optimization enabled you would copy
`test-src/` to e.g. `test-lowdepth/` and append `--low-depth` to
`test-lowdepth/CBMC_GC_FLAGS`. Then you would `cd` into `test-lowdepth` and run
`make run` to compile and execute all tests. (Note that this specific test-case
will be created by default so you don't need to actually do it.)

You can also build or run individual tests. Example: From a test directory
(e.g. `test-default/`) run:

    make build-addition_int32
    make run-addition_int32

This will first build and then run the test-case `addition_int32`.


#### Comparing test results


To get a quick overview of the number of non-XOR gates of each test use
`testcmp` to generate a HTML table:

    ./testcmp test-default test-lowdepth > comparison.html

This will create a table containing the results from the directories
`test-default/` and `test-lowdepth/` and write it to `comparison.html`.
You can specify an arbitrary number of test directories to compare.


#### Differential testing:


CBMC-GC has built support for differential testing of c code against
circuits. There are currently two possible ways to test a circuit: (1)
you can create a test-runner that generates random inputs and compares
the output of the circuit with the output of the original C version or
(2) you can *verify* that the circuit behaves exactly the same as the
C code. Whether you can use (2) depends on the complexity of the
circuit: if the circuit contains no multiplication or division then you
are often fine. 8-bit multiplication/division shouldn't cause any
problems either, but anything more is probably too much.

To generate a random-input test-runner for the circuit in file `adder.circ`,
execute the following:

    circuit-utils adder.circ --create-tester tester.cpp --reference adder.c

where `adder.c` must contain the C code for the circuit in `adder.circ`. The
output is a C++ file which, when compiled and executed, will test the circuit
and output any values that differ from the output of the C version.

To create a verifier, run:

    circuit-utils adder.circ --create-verifier verifier.c --reference adder.c

The resulting `verifier.c` file can then be fed into `cbmc`:

    cbmc verifier.c

If the verification is successful then the circuit should be equivalent to the C
code.

NOTE: Currently, creating tests poses some restrictions on the C code:

  1. The circuit must have exactly two input variables (one for each party).
     If a party must provide data in more than one variable put them into a
     struct.
  2. The types of `INPUT_A`, `INPUT_B` and of the output variable must be named
     `InputA`, `InputB` and `Output`, respectively.

Take a look at the test-cases for examples.
