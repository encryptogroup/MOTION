Tesing the functionality of goto-cc's linker script parsing
functionality, ensuring that it can get the values of symbols that are
defined in linker scripts.

This test ensures that goto-cc and ls-parse can:

- get the value of a symbol whose value indicates the start of a section;
- get the value of a symbol whose value indicates the end of a section.
